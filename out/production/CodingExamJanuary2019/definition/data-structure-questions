Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:


why do we need data structure?
Data structure are the way we use for organizing and storing data.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
on data structures we can add, modify, delete data.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
  -Compiler Design,
  -Operating System,
  -Database Management System,
  -Statistical analysis package,
  -Numerical Analysis,
  -Graphics,
  -Artificial Intelligence,
  - Simulation.

what is an Array?
An array is a container object that can stock or holds a fixed number of values of a same single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
the difference is in array the number of value is fixed but not in array list.

what is LinkedList?
LinkedList is a class ho uses a doubly linked list to store elements(values). It provides a linked-list data structure.
It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
In array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value. In case of a linked list,
each element points to the next, previous, or maybe both nodes.

what is queue?
Queue is an  interface(data structure), providing first in, first out  (FIFO) and last in last out(lilo).
it is implemented by linkedlist.

what is stack?
A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop.
The push operation adds an element at the top of the stack, and the pop operation removes an element from
the top of the stack.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO= first in first out.
LIFO= last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
Algorithmic complexity is concerned about how fast or slow particular algorithm performs. it define time taken
by an algorithm without depending on the implementation details.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-Best case is the function which performs the minimum number of steps on input data of n elements.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
-Worst case is the function which performs the maximum number of steps on input data of size n.

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear
data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the
root and zero or one or more subtrees.

what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also
referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java: Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than
synchronized ones.  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in
constant time O(1) provided we know the key. In hashing, hash functions are used to link key and value in HashMap.
Objects are stored by calling put(key, value) method of HashMap and retrieved by calling get(key) method. When we
call put method, hashcode() method of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a bucket
location to store value object, which is actually an index of the internal array, known as the table

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
